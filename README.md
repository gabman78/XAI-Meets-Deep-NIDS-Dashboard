# XAI-Meets-Deep-NIDS-Dashboard

**This dashboard represents the final outcome of the work presented in the paper _"XAI Meets Deep NIDS: SHAP-Guided Adversarial Analysis on SDN Traffic"_ by the Cyber Pandas team.**

---

The **XAI Dashboard for Deep Learning Network Traffic Classification** is a **web-based application** developed using **Streamlit**, designed to support the **explainability** and **evaluation** of a Deep Learning-based **Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)** tailored for **Software-Defined Networking (SDN)** environments.

This tool serves as the final output of the research work presented in the paper _"XAI Meets Deep NIDS: SHAP-Guided Adversarial Analysis on SDN Traffic"_ by the **Cyber Pandas** team. Its main objective is to offer **cybersecurity analysts** a **visual and interactive platform** to better understand how a deep neural model distinguishes between **benign and malicious traffic**, as well as to explore its **vulnerabilities**.

Upon accessing the dashboard, the **homepage** presents two main sections, as shown in the following image:

- **SDN Database**: Allows users to inspect the **structure and composition** of the dataset used for training, including **class distributions** and **attack categories**.
- **DL Network Analysis**: Enables exploration of the model‚Äôs decisions using **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)**, both at the **binary classification** level and across **specific attack types**.

</p>

The dashboard promotes **transparency**, supports **model introspection**, and assists in identifying **weak points** by enabling **guided adversarial perturbation analysis** ‚Äî all through a **user-friendly interface**.

## üìä SDN Database Analysis

The **SDN Database** section of the dashboard offers an interactive and visual exploration of the dataset used to train the intrusion detection model. This section is fully developed using **Streamlit** and integrates **Apache ECharts** to enable responsive and dynamic visualizations.

### üîç Dataset Overview

Upon accessing the SDN analysis view, users are immediately presented with a summary of the dataset:  
- **225,608** bidirectional flows  
- **13 features** per flow  
- **Binary labels** for benign/malicious classification  
- **Multi-class labels** for specific attack types  

The following visualization provides an immediate glance at the benign vs. malicious flow distribution:

</p>

### ü•ß Malicious Traffic Breakdown

To further detail the malicious flows, the dashboard includes:
- A **donut chart** showing the proportion of benign vs. malicious flows  
- A **pie chart** displaying the breakdown of malicious traffic by attack type (DDoS, Probe, DoS, BFA, Web-Attack)

All charts are **interactive**, allowing users to hover and isolate specific segments:

</p>

### üì¶ Statistical Visualizations


Users can also explore:
- **Boxplots** showing the distribution of packet counts and payload lengths across different traffic labels.

These visualizations help identify patterns and outliers in packet-level behavior. For example, users can analyze which attacks involve longer payloads or more packets in early flow stages.

Available boxplots include:
- **Pacchetti per LABEL**: Number of packets per attack category
- **Pacchetti per LABEL-bin**: Number of packets grouped by binary class (Benign vs Malicious)
- **Primo pacchetto per LABEL (PL_first)**: Payload length of the **first packet** across categories
- **Secondo pacchetto per LABEL (PL_second)**: Payload length of the **second packet**

All charts are interactive and rendered using **Apache ECharts**, enabling responsive tooltips, zooming, and highlighting on hover.

</p>

### üßæ Data Table Sampling

A sample of raw SDN flows is made available in a sortable and filterable table. Users can:
- Choose the number of rows to display
- Filter columns individually to focus on specific values

All these elements are rendered with **ECharts**, enabling high-performance, browser-based interactions. This makes the dashboard not only informative but also **highly usable** for security analysts, data scientists, or researchers exploring the dataset behavior in real time.
